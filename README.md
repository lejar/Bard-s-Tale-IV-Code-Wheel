# Bard-s-Tale-IV-Code-Wheel

This is a simple application for viewing the Bard's Tale IV code wheel on your computer.

## Installation

If you are on windows, the recommended way of installing this would be to check the releases for binaries.

If you want to run the code directly, then you can install the dependencies with python:
```python
python -mpip install -r requirements.txt
```

Once that is done, simply run
```bash
python setup.py build
python -mcode_wheel
```
to run the program.
